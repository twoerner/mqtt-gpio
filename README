mqtt-gpio
^^^^^^^^^
A program to link MQTT messages to actions.
An action, currently, can be one of:
- GPIO pins
- aritrary programs (CMD)

GPIO
^^^^
Given a configuration file (see extras/mqtt-gpio.conf as an example), the
user associates arbitrary MQTT topics with arbitrary GPIO pins (linked via
a user-created string). An "ON" message received on any specified topic
will turn on the associated GPIO pin; an "OFF" message does the opposite.

CMD
^^^
Actions can also be linked with commands. An mqtt "ON" message will run the
CMD, an "OFF" message will terminate it.


Originally, the only link that was made was between mqtt messages and GPIO
pins, hence the name.
