mqtt-gpio
^^^^^^^^^
A program to link MQTT messages to actions on GPIO pins.

Given a configuration file (see extras/mqtt-gpio.conf as an example), the
user associates arbitrary MQTT topics with arbitrary GPIO pins (linked via
a user-created string). An "ON" message received on any specified topic
will turn on the associated GPIO pin; an "OFF" message does the opposite.
